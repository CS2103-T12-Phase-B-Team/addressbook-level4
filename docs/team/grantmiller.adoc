=== Enhancement Added: Autocomplete

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=autocomplete]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

Autocomplete is a common feature among many applications. It greatly increases the ease of use for a user by speeding up their ability to complete common commands.

My implementation use a dropdown box to visually show the user what possible commands there are for an input, if any, as well as easily enabling the user to see the parameters for their command directly in the command line.
