<p>Autocomplete is a common feature among many applications. It greatly increases the ease of use for a user by speeding up their ability to complete common commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My implementation use a dropdown box to visually show the user what possible commands there are for an input, if any, as well as easily enabling the user to see the parameters for their command directly in the command line.</p>

<h3 id="autocomplete-2"><a class="link" href="#autocomplete-2">Autocomplete</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The autocomplete functionality is accomplished by using a character trie to store all possible commands. The trie has a very simple set of commands, shown below.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>public interface Trie {
    String attemptAutoComplete (String input);
    void insert (String input);
    Set&lt;String&gt; getCommandSet();
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trie is made up of node classes which only have three fields. The next field represents a character on the same level as the current one. The child represents a next possible letter. For example in the words edit and exit the node for 'd' would have a child 'i' and a next 'x'. 'x' would have a child 'i'.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>public class Node {

    private Node next;
    private Node child;
    private char key;
    ...
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upon the pressing of the tab key, the command box calls attemptAutoComplete, in the commandTrie class. This method will traverse the trie using the content of the command box. If the input has a character not present in the trie, then the attempt fails. If the trie parses through the input but reaches a node with a next option, it will attempt to provide the user with possible commands for a given input. In this case, a dropdown box will appear in the UI that lists the possible commands for the user. This is accomplished using a recursive searching of the trie that follows each possible path and returns a set of possible commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre> private List&lt;String&gt; recursiveGetOptions(Node start, String stub) {
        List&lt;String&gt; options = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
        StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();
        output.append(stub);

        while (!isLeaf(start)) {
            if (start.hasNext()) {
                options.addAll(recursiveGetOptions(start.getNext(), output.toString()));
                if (start.hasChild()) {
                    output.append(start.getKey());
                    options.addAll(recursiveGetOptions(start.getChild(), output.toString()));
                }
                return options;
            } else {
                output.append(start.getKey());
                start = start.getChild();
            }
        }
        output.append(start.getKey());
        options.add(output.toString());
        return options;
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the trie parses the input and reaches a node with only children, it will autocomplete the input to a valid command. If the autocomplete fails, the text is turned red.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An added functionality is that if the user presses tab again, the command will add a usage framework for the command, i.e. find will be autocompleted to find [names]. This helps the user to understand command usage. If tab is pressed again, the input simply reverts back to the command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One class, command collection, is used to hold the set of commands and a map from each command word to the command usage. This is used by the trie to both construct the command trie and autocomplete from a command word to a command word and its usage. This static class simply contains a set of each command&#8217;s command word that is statically initialized and used by the commandTrie class.</p>

<h3 id="groups"><a class="link" href="#groups">Groups</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The groups feature is implemented in every component of the addressbook. In the logic section, there are two new commands: group and filter. The group command takes care of creating, adding to, and deleting a group. The default group selection is "none", and it cannot be deleted. If a group is deleted, then a person is assigned the none group.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the model section, there is a new field in the person object for a group. This object simply contains the group name. In the addressbook, class there&#8217;s now a uniqueGroupList. This field is similar to the implementation for the Person List or Tag list. It keeps track of all groups within the addressbook and is used to sync when new groups are added or groups are deleted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In storage, the xml files have been updated to include the uniqueGroupList elements (XMLAdaptedGroup), as well as storing the group field for each person.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In UI, there&#8217;s now a list view that in a split panel that shows the menu on the left, and each created group on the right. Selecting a group will update the filtered list view to display only people in the selected group.</p>

<h4 id="design-considerations"><a class="link" href="#design-considerations">Design Considerations</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> Implementation of Groups vs Using Tags<br>
<strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Use Groups to filter view<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> Groups and tags can provide a more dynamic way of sorting your addressbook<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> Need whole new data structures to store groups and UI interfaces for presenting groups to user<br>
<strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Use tags to filter view<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to implement in UI, easy to implement filter<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> Tags are used to describe a person, while groups should be used to categorize. For example a tag may be friend, while the group would be Americans or Singaporeans. Having groups separate from tags allows for a more nuanced use of addressbook.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> Implementation of Groups using UniqueGroupList<br>
<strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Use UniqueGroupList and add method for existence in list+
<strong>Pros:</strong> Fits the current model for Persons and Tags and adds an easy way to check if a group exists without raising an exception+
<strong>Cons:</strong> Deviates a bit from the past implementation for the other uniqueLists+
<strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Use UniqueGroupList similar to UniquePersonList+
<strong>Pros:</strong> Fits model for other structures in addressbook+
<strong>Cons:</strong> Has some exceptions that make code cluttered and unclear+
<strong>Alternative 3:</strong> Use basic List Structure+
<strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to implement+
<strong>Cons:</strong> Would require extensive modifications to fit the existing model for addressbook</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> Placement of group selection listener<br>
<strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Placed in MainWindow and modified CommandBox for CLI-less command execution<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> Allows transparent execution of filter command and output into the result box using existing model as well as keeps listeners in the same class<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> Overloads execution method and has a public method in CommandBox for executing command<br>
<strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Place listener in CommandBox<br>
<strong>Pros:</strong> Keeps the listener in the same class as the execute method<br>
<strong>Cons:</strong> Clutters CommandBox by adding a listener to a class that doesn&#8217;t have any</p>
