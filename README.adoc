== Scenario

We have been asked create an address book that can be used by a tour guide to record the details of their customers. We have been given a generic address book program written in Java using OOP principles to build on with features that we would think will improve their experience.

The vision of this project is to create an address book that can be used safely, comfortably and navigated quickly by a tour guide with average computing experience.


Main features:

* This is a desktop Address Book application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is intended to be used by a tour guide to keep track of their contacts

More features listed in the UserGuide.

_Marco Jakob_.
